TO RUN THE CODE YOU CAN JUST UNCOMENT THE PART OF THE CODE IN MAIN, THERE IS A FUCNTION FOR EACH PART.
ALTHOUGHT TO PRINT THE POINTS ON THE PICTUERS i HAD TO DO IT STEP BY STEP, SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO UNCOMENT SOME OF THE PLT CODES IN THE
mosaic_indoor_Auto FUNCTION  you might need to add folder called photo since it should read from that folder but code works
please email me if there is any question sahba@berkeley.edu
